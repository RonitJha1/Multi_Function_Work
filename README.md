💻 Multi-Functional Python Console Program
This is a Python-based multifunctional console program developed by Ronit Jha. It provides three main utilities in a single program:

🧮 Grade Sheet Generator

📅 2025 Calendar Viewer

🏦 Simple Banking System

🌟 Features
1. Grade Sheet Generator
Collects names and marks of students in 5 subjects.

Calculates average percentage and assigns grades based on predefined grading rules.

Displays each student's marks, percentage, grade, and performance classification:

A+ (90%+), A (80–89%), B+ (70–79%), down to NG (Below 35%).

Highlights whether the marks are the highest, lowest, or average in the class.

2. 2025 Calendar
Generates monthly calendar views for any selected month in 2025.

Displays the days of the week and correct start days for each month.

3. Banking System (Laxmi Chit Fund)
Allows users to:

Create multiple customer accounts with PIN and balance.

Deposit money (with PIN verification).

Withdraw money (with balance check and PIN).

View balance securely.

Simulates a simple banking experience on the console.

🧠 How It Works
When the program runs, users are asked whether they want to use the system.

Based on input, it offers a menu-driven system for choosing between Grade, Calendar, or Banking functions.

All interactions are done via command-line interface (CLI), using input() and printed menus.

⚙️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3

Interface: Command Line (Console)

Modules: None (uses only core Python functionality)

📌 Future Improvements (Ideas)
Add support for different years in the calendar.

Export grade sheets to .txt or .csv files.

Add login and admin features in the banking system.

Use Python's calendar module for dynamic calendar generation.
